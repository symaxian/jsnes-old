A JavaScript NES emulator.
	by Jonathon Reesor
	original from Ben Firshman

Hasn't really been maintained lately.
Many improvements can still be made.
Feel free to use however you like.

Based off of Ben Firshman's jsnes, which is in turn based off of vNes.

Source Files:

	nes.js
		Defines the nes object.

		Mostly functional.
			Saving BatteryROM does not work and is disabled.
		Features can be added.
		Cannot be improved.

	cpu.js
		Defines the nes.cpu object.
		Fully emulates the nes's cpu.

		Fully functional.
		Features cannot be added.
		Cannot be improved.

	ppu.js
		Defines the nes.ppu(picture proccessing unit) object.
		Generates the frame, which is written to the canvas in the nes.screen object.

		Fully functional, possibly buggy.
		Features cannot be added.
		Can probably be improved.

	apu.js
		Defines the nes.apu(audio processing unit) object.
		Generates sound samples, which are then fed into the dynamic audio object.

		Depends on lib/dynamicaudio.js
			Which depends on lib/jquery-1.4.2.min.js
			Which depends on lib/dynamicaudio.swf

		Fully funtional, somewhat buggy.
			Sound can seem "skippy".
			Dynamic audio object does not always load properly(seems to be rare).
		Features cannot be added.
		Can probably be improved.

	mappers.js
		Defines the nes.mappers object.
		Needed for loading roms, mappers 0,1,2,and 4 are fully/partially implemented.

		Mostly functional, latter mappers might have bugs.
		Features(the other mappers) can be added.
			I think theres like maybe ~60 more mappers, some of which are very rare to find.
			Can probably port other mappers over from vNes.
		Cannot probably be improved.

For more information just look at the code, I'm sure its not as dreadful as you imagine, I'm unusually finicky about commenting quantity and quality.
