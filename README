A JavaScript NES emulator.


Currently unsupported and untouched in months, might be picked up later.
Feel free to use however you like.


Based off of Ben Firshman's jsNes, which is in turn based off of vNes.


Source Files:

	nes.js
		Must be included first, defines the nes object.
		The main nes object holding components and most editable settings.

		Mostly functional.
			Saving BatteryROM does not work and is disabled.
		Features can be added.
		Cannot be improved.

	cpu.js
		Adds the cpu(central processing unit) object to the nes.
		Fully emulates the nes's cpu.

		Fully functional.
		Features cannot be added.
		Cannot be improved.

	ppu.js
		Adds the ppu(picture proccessing unit) object to the nes.
		Generates the frame, which is written to the canvas in the nes.screen object.

		Fully functional, possibly buggy.
		Features cannot be added.
		Can probably be improved.

	apu.js
		Adds the apu(audio processing unit) object to the nes.
		Generates sound samples, which are then fed into the dynamic audio object.
		Depends on lib/dynamicaudio.js
			Depends on lib/jquery-1.4.2.min.js
			Depends on lib/dynamicaudio.swf

		Fully funtional, possibly buggy.
			Sound can seem "skippy".
			Dynamic audio object does not always load properly(rare).
		Features cannot be added.
		Can probably be improved.

	mappers.js
		Adds the implemented mappers to the nes.
		Needed for loading roms, mappers 0,1,2,and 4 are fully/partially implemented.

		Mostly functional, latter mappers have bugs.
		Features(the other mappers) can be added.
		Cannot probably be improved.

For more information just consult the code, I'm unusually finicky about commenting quantity and quality.
